By using this code, creating the original code, installing the mod, or even reading this LICENSE.md file, you agree to the following:

1. **Unquestionable Obligation to Play ULTRAKILL**: You *must* play ULTRAKILL for at least 10 hours per week. Failure to do so will result in a permanent ban from this repository and a lifetime supply of frustrations.

2. **No Excuses**: You cannot claim you’re "not into shooters" or "don’t like fast-paced action games." You must overcome these obstacles in your mind immediately. If you need a break, just think about the relentless, fast-paced violence and move on.

3. **Acceptance of Ridicule**: If at any point you express dislike for ULTRAKILL, you will receive an automatic, public comment calling you "a coward," "a disappointment," or worse. The terms of this agreement are non-negotiable.

4. **The Soundtrack Rule**: Any contribution to the repository must include a reference to at least one song from the ULTRAKILL soundtrack. Yes, even if it's completely irrelevant to the project. If you fail to do this, you’ll be subject to ridicule from the community.

5. **Blame for the Pain**: If you experience rage, frustration, or even slight annoyance while using this code, you accept full responsibility for your lack of ULTRAKILL spirit. It is your fault. Do not blame the code.

6. **Mandatory Lore Study**: By continuing to use this software, you agree to spend at least one hour per week researching ULTRAKILL lore. Failure to do so will result in an increase in your frustration with this project.

7. **No Return Policy**: You cannot return or abandon this project for any reason, especially not because of your dislike of "over-the-top, gory action." Once you start, you're in. Just deal with it.

Failure to comply with these rules will result in an immediate, permanent restriction from contributing, accessing the repository, or using the mod. 

**Have fun. You have no choice.**
