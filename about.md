# ReSpeed

Truly the <cy>pinnacle</c> of customisation. This mod allows you to tweak the speed of each speed portal <cr>individually</c> from one another.

Want to make the speed of each portal more identical to the look of the portals themselves? <cg>Go ahead!</c>
Want to randomise the speed of each portal so that no two playthroughs of the stage are ever the same? <cg>Feel free!</c>
Want to not do any of this and just play the game? <cg>Cool!</c> All of this can be easily disabled in the settings!

# NOTE:
These are the values used by the game's logic to determine the speed of the player at each portal:
- 0.5x portal: 0.7f
- 1.0x portal: 0.9f
- 2.0x portal: 1.1f
- 3.0x portal: 1.3f
- 4.0x portal: 1.6f

Why is the 1.0x portal at 0.9 and not... y'know... 1.0? idk
